# Sensor-Based Vehicle Controller (Unity)

A physics-based autonomous vehicle system developed in Unity using C#,  
focused on **raycast-based sensing, obstacle detection, and smooth vehicle control**.

This project demonstrates clean gameplay logic, sensor integration, and real-time
decision-making without using external AI libraries.

## 🚗 Project Overview

The vehicle navigates autonomously using front, left, and right raycast sensors.
Based on obstacle detection, it dynamically adjusts steering and speed to avoid
collisions while maintaining smooth movement.
